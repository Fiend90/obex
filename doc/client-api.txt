Client hierarchy
================

Service		org.openobex.client
Interface	org.openobex.Client
Object path	/

Methods		object CreateSession(string destination, dict args)

			Create a new OBEX session for the given remote address.

			The last parameter is a dictionary to hold optional or
			type-specific parameters. Typical parameters that can
			be set in this dictionary include the following:

				string "Target" : type of session to be created
				string "Source" : local address to be used
				byte "Channel"

			The currently supported targets are the following:

				"FTP"
				"MAP"
				"OPP"
				"PBAP"
				"SYNC"

		void RemoveSession(object session)

			Unregister session and abort pending transfers.

Session hierarchy
=================

Service		org.openobex.client
Interface	org.openobex.Session
Object path	[variable prefix]/{session0,session1,...}

Methods		dict GetProperties()

			Returns all properties for the session.

		string GetCapabilities()

			Get remote device capabilities.

Properties	string Source [readonly]

		string Destination [readonly]

		byte Channel [readonly]

Object Push hierarchy
=====================

Service		org.openobex.client
Interface	org.openobex.ObjectPush
Object path	[variable prefix]/{session0,session1,...}

Methods		object, dict SendFile(string sourcefile)

			Send one local file to the remote device.

			The returned path represents the newly created transfer,
			which should be used to find out if the content has been
			successfully transferred or if the operation fails.

			The properties of this transfer are also returned along
			with the object path, to avoid a call to GetProperties.

		object, dict PullBusinessCard(string targetfile)

			Request the business card from a remote device and
			store it in the local file.

			If an empty target file is given, a name will be
			automatically calculated for the temporary file.

			The returned path represents the newly created transfer,
			which should be used to find out if the content has been
			successfully transferred or if the operation fails.

			The properties of this transfer are also returned along
			with the object path, to avoid a call to GetProperties.

		object, dict ExchangeBusinessCards(string clientfile,
							string targetfile)

			Push the client's business card to the remote device
			and then retrieve the remote business card and store
			it in a local file.

			If an empty target file is given, a name will be
			automatically calculated for the temporary file.

			The returned path represents the newly created transfer,
			which should be used to find out if the content has been
			successfully transferred or if the operation fails.

			The properties of this transfer are also returned along
			with the object path, to avoid a call to GetProperties.

Methods		void ChangeFolder(string folder)

			Change the current folder of the remote device.

		void CreateFolder(string folder)

			Create a new folder in the remote device.

		array{dict} ListFolder()

			Returns a dictionary containing information about
			the current folder content.

				uint64 Size : Object size or number of items in
						folder
				string Permission : Group, owner and other
							permission
				uint64 Modified : Last change
				uint64 Accessed : Last access
				uint64 Created : Creation date

		object, dict GetFile(string targetfile, string sourcefile)

			Copy the source file (from remote device) to the
			target file (on local filesystem).

			If an empty target file is given, a name will be
			automatically calculated for the temporary file.

			The returned path represents the newly created transfer,
			which should be used to find out if the content has been
			successfully transferred or if the operation fails.

			The properties of this transfer are also returned along
			with the object path, to avoid a call to GetProperties.

		object, dict PutFile(string sourcefile, string targetfile)

			Copy the source file (from local filesystem) to the
			target file (on remote device).

			The returned path represents the newly created transfer,
			which should be used to find out if the content has been
			successfully transferred or if the operation fails.

			The properties of this transfer are also returned along
			with the object path, to avoid a call to GetProperties.

		void CopyFile(string sourcefile, string targetfile)

			Copy a file within the remote device from source file
