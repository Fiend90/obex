Background
==========

- Priority scale: High, Medium and Low

- Complexity scale: C1, C2, C4 and C8.  The complexity scale is exponential,
  with complexity 1 being the lowest complexity.  Complexity is a function
  of both task 'complexity' and task 'scope'.

  The general rule of thumb is that a complexity 1 task should take 1-2 weeks
  for a person very familiar with BlueZ codebase.  Higher complexity tasks
  require more time and have higher uncertainty.

  Higher complexity tasks should be refined into several lower complexity tasks
  once the task is better understood.

General
==========

- OBEX Actions are used to perform actions not primarily defined as OBEX
  commands. This actions include, for example, moving, copying and setting the
  permissions of objects. OBEX actions would be very useful when implementing
  virtual filesystems over OBEX.

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C2
